✅ 1. Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform basic mathematical operations.


Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	a + b
-	Subtraction	a - b
*	Multiplication	a * b
/	Division	a / b
%	Modulus (remainder)	a % b
++	Increment	a++
--	Decrement	a--


✅ 2. Assignment Operators
Operator	Description	Example
=	Assign	x = 10
+=	Add and assign	x += 5
-=	Subtract and assign	x -= 5
*=	Multiply and assign	x *= 2
/=	Divide and assign	x /= 2
%=	Modulus and assign	x %= 3


✅ 3. Comparison Operators
Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to (loose)	x == "5"
===	Equal to (strict)	x === 5
!=	Not equal	x != 10
!==	Not equal (strict)	x !== "10"
>	Greater than	x > y
<	Less than	x < y
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y


✅ 4. Logical Operators
Operator	Description	Example
&&	Logical AND	a > 5 && b < 10
`		`
!	Logical NOT	!(a > b)

✅ 5. Bitwise Operators (Rarely used, but powerful)

Operator	Description
&	AND
`	`
^	XOR
~	NOT
<<	Left shift
>>	Right shift
>>>	Unsigned right shift


✅ 6. Ternary Operator
let result = (a > b) ? "A is bigger" : "B is bigger";


✅ 7. Type Operators
Operator	Description	Example
typeof	Returns type	typeof 123 → "number"
instanceof	Checks object type	obj instanceof Array
