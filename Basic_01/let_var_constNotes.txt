In JavaScript, let, var, and const are used to declare variables, but they differ in how they behave in terms of scope, hoisting, and reassignment.

Let’s break it down simply:

✅ var, let, and const – No Data Type Required
Unlike Java or C++, JavaScript is dynamically typed, so you don’t declare a type (int, String, etc.). You just write:


let name = "Muneer";       // String
var age = 25;              // Number
const isTester = true;     // Boolean
JavaScript figures out the type at runtime.

🔍 Difference Between var, let, and const

Feature	var	let	const
Scope	Function-scoped	Block-scoped {}	Block-scoped {}
Hoisting	Yes (initialized as undefined)	Yes (but not initialized)	Yes (but not initialized)
Reassignable	✅ Yes	✅ Yes	❌ No (constant after assignment)
Redeclarable	✅ Yes (in same scope)	❌ No	❌ No
🧠 Examples:

function test() {
  if (true) {
    var x = 10;
    let y = 20;
    const z = 30;
  }
  console.log(x); // ✅ Works (var is function-scoped)
  // console.log(y); ❌ Error (let is block-scoped)
  // console.log(z); ❌ Error (const is block-scoped)
}
✅ Best Practice (Which one should you use?)
➡️ Use const by default.
If you don’t plan to reassign the variable, use const. It's safer and avoids bugs.

➡️ Use let when you know you’ll reassign it.
For example, loop counters, dynamic values.

❌ Avoid var — it’s outdated and can lead to unexpected issues due to hoisting and function-scoping.

🔔 Quick Tip:

const name = "Muneer";   // Good ✅
let counter = 0;         // Good ✅
var globalVar = true;    // Avoid ❌
